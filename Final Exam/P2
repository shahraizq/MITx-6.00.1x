You have the following class hierarchy:
class A(object):
    def foo(self):
        print('hi')
class B(A):
    def foo(self):
        print('bye')
          

Which of the following is correct?

When a = A() we say that a is an instance of A (Correct)
When b = B() we say that b is a subclass of A
Both of the above
Neither of the above

Problem 2-4
1/1 point (graded)
Consider the following two functions and select the correct choice below:

def foo_one(n):
    """ Assume n is an int >= 0 """
    answer = 1.0
    while n > 1:
        answer *= n
        n -= 1
    return answer

def foo_two(n):
    """ Assume n is an int >= 0 """
    if n <= 1: 
        return 1.0
    else: 
        return n*foo_two(n-1)


The worst case Big Oh time complexity of foo_one is worse than the worst case Big Oh time complexity of foo_two.
The worst case Big Oh time complexity of foo_two is worse than the worst case Big Oh time complexity of foo_one.
The worst case Big Oh time complexity of foo_one and foo_two are the same. (Correct)
Impossible to compare the worst case Big Oh time complexities of the two functions.
