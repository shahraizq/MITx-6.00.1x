Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

s += ' '
news = ''
stringarray = []

for i in range(len(s)-1):
    left = s[i]
    right= s[i+1]
    
    if left <= right:
        news += left
    if left > right:
        news += left
        stringarray.append (news)
#        print (news)
        
        news = ''
    if left <= right:
        stringarray.append (news)
#        print (news)
print (max(stringarray, key=len))
